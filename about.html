      <p>I knew from the very beginning of the project that I wanted to use
        the created friend characters to play with data, but I didn't want to
        just phone it in like this "Stats" concept from my brainstorming period.
      </p>
      <p>Before I could properly get started on a much better compatability tester
        idea that I had in mind for this project from the inception of the project,
        I needed to update the rest of the website to ensure it could scale to 
        accommodate ideas that went beyond the creation of a single friend.
      </p>
      <p>I needed to sort out 3 key aspects of my site before I could even 
        <em>think</em> about creating this feature:</p>
      <ol class="h3List">
        <li>
          <h3>Index Page</h3>
          <p>The old index page was just the creator page, and considering
            my ambitions for the site had now outgrown a character creator,
            my first course of action was to make a new page to greet users
            visiting FriendLibrary.
          </p>

          <p>This site takes <em>heavy</em> inspiration from the original
          concept behind Nintendo's <em>Tomodachi Life</em> series and the
          Mii characters in general, so I knew I wanted the "things" users
          do with their created Friends to things like compatability testers
          and horoscope readings. Like the original Japanese title of the
          aformentioned series implies, I want users to create a [Tomodachi]
          <em>Collection</em> of caricatures of the people they know, so
          features supporting this main concept needed to support the idea
          that by creating all of these codes, users are beginning their own
          "database" of sorts.</p>
          <img src="assets/devlog/old_index.png" alt="An early depiction of the
          home menu, with a scrapped Fortune Telling option depicted by two
          renditions of the same woman character: one young and one old">
          <p>To that end, for a minute the first of these features I
            wanted to implement was the planned fortune teller that would
            show a Friend's projected luck in multiple areas throughout the
            upcoming week. I even implemented its icon, which featured a
            FriendLibrary sample character in both young and old stages, and
            had it replace the Affinity Tester, which you can see by the shared
            magenta color scheme the two both have.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/devlog/old_index2.png" alt="The other selected button
          in this older index rendition, showing three Sample characters as
          representitives of the Creator mode's capabilities">
          <p>Speaking of the index icons, I had a lot of fun coding the CSS
            animations for the characters that pop up whenever you hover over
            the icon. I also wanted to make sure I could reuse the same properties
            for different icons with minimal code. The characters pop up at different
            rates depending on their tag, with the middle showing in front and going
            up the highest. I designed the characters to not look too much like any
            specific person in my life, but instead as the perfect representitives 
            for the different kind of people you can depict with my intentionally
            limited tools. You can even find a few of these on the <a href="samples.html">
            Samples</a> page. Of course, these are just close recreations based on
            saved images because my other issue at this point was the lack of...

          <h3>Working Codes</h3>
          <p>I had actually begun developing a code solution that was working fairly
            well before V1's last-minute refactor that de-centralized a lot of the
            logic powering the friend creator, but when reimplementing the logic, I
            decided to start from scratch. Instead of creating the code within the
            creator's javascript file, I decided to give the logic to the friend's class,
            so that anywhere the friend was, it could be copied. Because I had designed
            the class as a dictionary of attributes anyway, automating the encoding
            process was <em>relatively</em> painless, though there were several hiccups
            the more I tried to shrink the code.
          </p>
          <p>I knew I wanted to represent the floating-point values in a different base
            than 10 to truncate the characters used, but it took a surprising amount of
            research online to come to the simple realization that the best way to standardize
            the character length of each value with my current parameters was to do a bit
            of multiplication to convert each float into Base36 with two digit places. After
            this I had some issues with the way colors loaded and rotation worked, but these
            were solved with minimal issue. After getting a good foundation in to save and
            load characters, (Finally!) I knew there was one more step before I could
            play with them...

          <h3>Getting the Data</h3>
          <p>Remember that aforementioned luck calendar idea from earlier? A big part of
            the reason it was put on the backburner was my struggles during this stage of
            the process... (Devlog in progress)
